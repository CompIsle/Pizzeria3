Some examples for code review for a beginner's course in OOP. The code in not intended to be any of correct, complete, or coherent: it is to provide students with points for discusssion.

Two versions are provided, one in C# and one in Python. The C# version was written first and the Python version written to be as similar as possible - ie the Python might not be completely Pythonic in places. In particular abstract base classes are used to replace the interfaces in the C# version - and it might be argued they are unnecessary and simple duck typing would do the job.
